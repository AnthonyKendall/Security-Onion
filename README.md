# PROJECTNAME
Security Onion

## Objective
The objective of Security Onion is to provide a comprehensive, open-source Linux distribution for network security monitoring (NSM), intrusion detection, and log management. It integrates various security tools, such as Suricata, Zeek, and the Elastic Stack, to help organizations detect, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity threats. Security Onion aims to offer a unified platform for threat hunting, incident response, and security monitoring, making it easier for security teams to identify and mitigate potential risks in real-time.

### Skills Learned
- Network Traffic Analysis: Monitoring and analyzing network traffic using tools like Zeek and Suricata.
- Intrusion Detection: Setting up and configuring intrusion detection systems (IDS) to identify security threats.
- Log Management: Collecting, parsing, and managing logs for effective threat hunting and incident response.
- Security Incident Response: Investigating and responding to security incidents using Security Onion's dashboards and tools.
- Data Correlation: Correlating data from multiple sources (network, host, and logs) for comprehensive threat analysis.
- Threat Hunting: Using Elastic Stack for searching and identifying anomalies or malicious activity.
- Alert Tuning: Customizing and fine-tuning alerts to reduce false positives and enhance detection accuracy.
- Elastic Stack Management: Working with Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Logstash for data visualization and analysis.


## Steps Taken

First, I had to navigate to Security Onion's website to find the documentation to get the ISO file. For this setup, I will be installing it as a standalone ISO. However, you could install it in Amazon Cloud, Azure, etc.. just refer to the documentation.
